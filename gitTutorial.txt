This is Git and Github tutorial.

git init -> initializes git repo locally
git add filename -> to add new file to local repository
git add . -> to add all new files at once locally
git commit -m "message" -> to commit with a custom message
git status -> to check how many files are unstaged or uncommited
git log -> to get details of all previous commits

To push local repository to remote repository using Github:
git remote add origin httplink -> adds a remote in our github account
git push -u origin master-> pushes all our commits from local repo to remote repo on the master branch.
Note: you can specify any other branch name as well but you will have to first change the branch and then push it

Branching:
git branch -> to list all branches
git branch branchname -> to create a new branch with custom name
git checkout branchname -> to switch to specified branch
git merge branchname -> to merge specified branch with the master branch
